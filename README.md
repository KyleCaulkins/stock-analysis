# Stock-Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this excercise was to help a friend, Steve, analyze stocks at the click of a button. Steve was interested in annual *Return* and *Total Daily Volume* of shares traded. The analysis began as a way to investigate shares of DAQO New Energy Corporation, but soon Steve wanted to expand the analysis. What started as a single share calculation expanded to a dozen shares and then Steve wanted the ability to look at a many more shares. The original code worked well for small amounts of data but may not work well for large amounts of data, or may tak a long time. The code was *refractored* in order to produce the same information but allow the VBA script to run faster.
