# Stock-Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this excercise was to help a friend, Steve, analyze stocks at the click of a button. Steve was interested in annual *Return* and *Total Daily Volume* of shares traded. The analysis began as a way to investigate shares of DAQO New Energy Corporation, but soon Steve wanted to expand the analysis. What started as a single share calculation expanded to a dozen shares and then Steve wanted the ability to look at a many more shares. The original code worked well for small amounts of data but may not work well for large amounts of data, or may tak a long time. The code was *refactored* in order to produce the same information but allow the VBA script to run faster.

## Summary
-What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
In this challenge, refactoring code was the primary objective. The main driver for refactoring this code was to reduce the time taken to produce results from analysis. The time difference could be much larger for a larger data set. Other advantages to refactoring code could be to remove bugs, make the code easier to follow, allow for a new function, make it easier to modify, and to improve performance. 
The idea behind refactoring is t
-How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the originial VBA script?
